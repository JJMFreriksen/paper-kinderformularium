# Pre-processing systematic review data for the Dutch Pediatric Formulary

This repository is part of a project of the Dutch Pediatric Formulary to evaluate
the benefit of using ASReview LAB for the development of Risk Benefit Analysis (RBA).
More specific, within this project the following is investigated:

1. What relevant information can be retrieved by using ASReview LAB for screening on top of
the results found within an existing Risk Benefit Analysis?
2. How many relevant papers can be identified using a broader search strategy and using ASReview LAB for screening, instead of the existing review strategy?

Within this repository one can find the scripts that are used to pre-process the
Risk Analysis Documents to ASReview LAB compatible input files.
